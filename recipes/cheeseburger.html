        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 pound Cooper® Sharp White or Yellow cheese, sliced</li>
        <li> pound lean ground beef*</li>1
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 leafy green lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>2 hamburger buns with seeds</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Set aside 4 slices of the Cooper® Sharp cheese. 
            You’ll use these on the burgers, 
            so keep them in the fridge until you’re ready for them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook macaroni according to package directions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a 3-quart saucepan until sizzling.
            Stir in flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.
            Add milk and cook over medium heat, 
            stirring constantly until mixture thickens (about 5-7 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to low. Stir in remaining Cooper® Sharp cheese slices
            (not the 4 slices in your fridge), stirring constantly until cheese
            is melted. Add cooked macaroni and stir well.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, mix ground beef, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.
            Form into 4 patties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the burgers in a medium skillet for 6-8 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F,
            and burgers are browned all the way through. On two of the burgers, during the last minute or so of cooking,
            layer 2 slices of Cooper® Sharp each.
            Continue heating until the cheese is as melty as you like it.
        </li>
    </ol>
