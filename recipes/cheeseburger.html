    <h5>The Mac n Cheese Burger You'll [Forever] Be Addicted to</h5>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 pound Sharp White or Yellow cheese, sliced</li>
        <li> pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 leafy green lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>2 hamburger buns with seeds</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Set aside 4 slices of the Cooper® Sharp cheese. 
            You’ll use these on the burgers, 
            so keep them in the fridge until you’re ready for them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook macaroni according to package directions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a 3-quart saucepan until sizzling.
            Stir in flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.
            Add milk and cook over medium heat, 
            stirring constantly until mixture thickens (about 5-7 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to low. Stir in remaining Cooper® Sharp cheese slices
            (not the 4 slices in your fridge), stirring constantly until cheese
            is melted. Add cooked macaroni and stir well.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, mix ground beef, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.
            Form into 4 patties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the burgers in a medium skillet for 6-8 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F,
            and burgers are browned all the way through. On two of the burgers, during the last minute or so of cooking,
            layer 2 slices of Cooper® Sharp each.
            Continue heating until the cheese is as melty as you like it.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Assembly</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Place a piece of lettuce on the bottom section of one of the buns and add one burger patty (without cheese).
        Scoop a generous portion of the mac and cheese onto the burger. Layer the second burger patty (with cheese) on top of the mac and cheese. 
        Top the burger with a condiment of your choice and place the top of the bun on the burger.
